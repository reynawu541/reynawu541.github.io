I am a Ph.D. student at University of Toronto Department of Computer Science, supervised by Professor Steve Easterbrook. My research interests are: climate informatics, human-computer interaction, and explainable AI. My current project looks into the roles of explainable AI in climate science and how climate scientists envision the use of machine learning. 

I graduated from Wake Forest University with honors in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics.
