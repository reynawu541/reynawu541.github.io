I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Professor [Steve Easterbrook](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/).

My research sits at the intersection of climate informatics, human–computer interaction, and explainable AI. My dissertation adopts a mixed-methods approach that integrates quantitative climate and ML analyses with qualitative studies of climate scientists’ lived experiences. This work examines how machine learning functions as a sociotechnical system within scientific workflows, epistemic cultures, and institutional infrastructures, and identifies gaps between prevailing ML framings and scientists’ situated needs.

I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics with honors from Wake Forest University. I then earned my MSc in financial technology at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
