I am a Ph.D. student at University of Toronto Department of Computer Science, supervised by Professor [Steve Easterbrook](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/). 

My research interests are: climate informatics, human-computer interaction, and explainable AI. My current project looks into the roles of explainable AI in climate science and how climate scientists envision the use of machine learning. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics with honors from Wake Forest University. I then earned my MSc in financial technology at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
